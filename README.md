# Workspace Switcher for MATE desktop.

## Overview
This script lets you easily create, delete, and move workspaces along with all
the windows they contain.

## Requirements
This script requires `wmctrl`, `zenity`, and `python3`.

On a Debian system, these can be installed with:

`sudo apt install wmctrl`

`sudo apt install zenity`

`sudo apt install python3`
 
## Example Commands

Example Commands | Description
--- | ---
workspace.py help | Display this help.
workspace.py list | List all workspaces.
workspace.py listwin | List all windows.
workspace.py listwin 8 | List all windows in workspace 8.
workspace.py switch 4 | Switch to workspace 4.
workspace.py rename 3 "foo bar" | Rename workspace 3 to "foo bar".

workspace.py gui\_rename | Open a dialog box to rename the current workspace.
workspace.py gui\_switch | Open a dialog box to list all the workspaces and allow the user to switch to another workspace.

## Installation

Copy the scripts to your favorite directory. Make sure its executable bit is on.

Now create keyboard shortcuts to your favorite commands. 

On my system running Debian MATE, the keyboard shortcuts can be found in the menu under
`System > Preferences > Hardware > Keyboard Shortcuts`.

Or it can be found directly here:
`mate-keybinding-properties`

I recommend the following key bindings

Key Combination | Command
 --- | ---
`<ctrl><alt>L` | `workspace.py gui_switch`
`<ctrl><alt>R` | `workspace.py gui_rename`

This works for me because it's similar to pre-existing bindings:

Key Combination | Command
 --- | ---
`<ctrl><alt><left>` | switch one workspace to the left.
`<ctrl><alt><right>` | switch one workspace to the right.

If `<ctrl><alt>L` is bound to lock screen, then you could rebind
lock screen to `<mod4>L` instead.
